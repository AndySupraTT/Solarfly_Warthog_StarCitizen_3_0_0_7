QUICK START
-------------------
1. Delete old files in your StarCitizen\User\Control\Mappings folder.  Unzip the solarfly.zip file and copy everything into your StarCitizen\User\Control\Mappings folder.

2. Make sure you have the latest version of T.A.R.G.E.T from Thrustmaster: https://ts.thrustmaster.com. Do NOT bother anyone for help if you haven't done so!

3. Load StarCitizen_Solarfly_v3xx.tmc into TARGET Script. Edit and save pilot_settings.tmh. RUN.

4. Run your USB/Game Controllers utility and see what order your devices are in

5. Start Star Citizen.

4. In both Arena Commander and Universe, you will have to 
   a.  pp_rebindkeys
   b.  pp_rebindkeys layout_Thrustmaster1_Rud2_v35 (Currently a ruddered version, will do a non rudder later. Just rebind in Star Citizen yaw and strafe back
   c.  Optionally, load your rudder overlay file (see Detailed Installation below)



ABOUT Solarfly
--------
I'm a professional tools developer for a startup in the Bay Area. I have been writing
and updating this Warthog HOTAS profile since StarCitizen Arena Commander 0.8 was
released. Now we're up to StarCitizen 2.0 Alpha and things keep getting better, but more
complicated too!

Thanks to the Warthog community that took the time to give their tremendously helpful
feedback on the Star Citizen forums and contribute to help shape this first pass at a 
more complete and useful Thrustmaster Warthog interface.

Happy flying!
